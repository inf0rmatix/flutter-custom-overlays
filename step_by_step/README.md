# ðŸš¶ Understanding overlays in Flutter, step by step.

This project accompanies my [talk on custom overlays in Flutter](https://youtu.be/bljfDlnQS9w?t=4719).
It's aim is to gradually deepen the understanding of how to use [Overlay](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Overlay-class.html) and displaying your own overlays with the help of [OverlayEntry](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/OverlayEntry-class.html).

I recommend you to start left to right, following the order of the tabs in this application.
You'd want to have a good understanding of the code, what happens and why, before proceeding to the next step.
